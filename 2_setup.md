# Setting up your environment

## Downloading Python for your machine

The first step to installing Python is going to https://www.python.org/.

Once you find the correct installer for your machine and finish installing it you can type into your console or command prompt `python --version`. If that doesn't work try other variations of `python3`, `python3.VERSION`, and `py`.

For this tutorial I will use the `python` command.

## Using the Interactive Interpreter

You can open Python's interactive interpreter by typing `python`.

An interpreter will appear and you can type any python code into it.

Try typing `print("Hello, World!")` into the interpreter and printing a string.

A string is a data type, which we will learn about later.

If you'd like to, you can expirement with different text.

To get out of the python interpreter just type `exit()`

## Running a Python file

To run a Python file you can either use an IDE extension like PyLance for Visual Studio Code or you can use the command line.

### Using Visual Studio Code

When you have Visual Studio Code installed there will be a play button in the top right corner of the screen. You can use this to easily run the file.

It will open a console inside the editor.

### Using the Command Line

To run a file from the command line you must know where the file is.


Use this command to run a python file in the terminal.

```bash
python3 path/to/file.py
```

## Assignment

Create a Python file that prints "Hello, World!" and run it.
