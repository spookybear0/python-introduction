# Introduction to Python

Python is a programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.

## Uses

* Web development
* Machine Learning and AI
* Math
* Scripting

A classic saying from Python developers is "You can do anything in Python, just not well".

The reason people say this is because Python is an interpreted language.

Interpreted languages run slower because they don't run on machine code, they are built on top of other languages. Python is built on top of C.

This doesn't mean you shouldn't use Python, the difference in speed is not very high and for most use cases it won't even matter.

## Benefits

* It works on multiple different platforms
* It has simple syntax

## Syntax differences

Python uses whitespace and indentation to format code. In other languages this is usually optional but in Python it is required for the language to understand. Most other langauges use curly braces {} to define scope, while python uses indentation/whitespace.

Most code IDEs (Interactive Development Enviroment) will replace indents with 4 spaces. This is the recommended way to code in Python.

## Quick example

Before setting up your Python installation, here's a quick example of what the most basic form of a python program looks like.

```py
print("Hello, World!")
```

No, this doesn't connect to your printer and print the text "Hello, World!".

It actually just prints "Hello, World!" to the terminal.

In the next chapter we will learn how to setup your Python environment.
